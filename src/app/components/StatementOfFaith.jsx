        <div className="font-bold">WHAT WE BELIEVE</div>
        <div className="font-semibold lg:text-5xl text:2xl">STATEMENT</div>
        <p>
          We believe that there is only one true God who is the eternal King,
          Creator, and Redeemer of all that is. He is perfectly holy, just,
          loving, and truthful. He has revealed Himself to be eternally
          self-existent one being in three persons: God the Father, God the Son,
          and God the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that the Bible is the inspired and only infallible and
          authoritative Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that humankind was created in the image of God to know and
          enjoy Him, yet we willfully rejected the Lordship and glory of God for
          which we were intended. Because of this, sickness, death, and judgment
          entered the world and now creation experiences the effects and
          consequences of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the one and only Son of God, was
          conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, and is
          God&apos;s Anointed One, empowered by the Holy Spirit to inaugurate
          God&apos;s kingdom on earth. He was crucified for our sins, died, was
          buried, resurrected, and ascended into heaven, and is now alive today
          in the presence of God the Father and in His people. He is "true God"
          and "true man."
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that we are saved by God&apos;s grace, through faith in the
          person and work of Jesus Christ. Anyone can be restored to fellowship
          with God through repenting, believing, and receiving Jesus as their
          Savior and Lord. The Holy Spirit convicts, regenerates, justifies,
          sanctifies, and adopts us as we enter the kingdom of God as His sons
          and daughters. We believe in the ongoing, sanctifying power of the
          Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a
          holy life and minister super-naturally. The baptism of the Holy
          Spirit, according to Acts 1:4-8 and 2:4, is poured out on believers
          that they might have God&apos;s power to be His witnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in the victorious, redemptive work of Christ on the cross
          provides freedom from the power of the enemy sin, lies, sickness, and
          torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that the Church consists of all who put their faith in
          Jesus Christ. He gave His Church the ordinances of baptism and
          communion. The Church exists to carry on the ministry of Jesus Christ
          and further advance His kingdom by undoing the works of the enemy,
          preaching and living the good news of God&apos;s love, and discipling
          the nations baptizing and teaching them to love and obey God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in the ever-increasing government of God and in the Blessed
          Hope, which is the glorious, visible return of the Lord Jesus Christ
          to rule and reign with His overcoming bride the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that heaven and hell are real places. There will be a
          resurrection of the lost and the saved, the one to everlasting death
          and the other to everlasting life.
